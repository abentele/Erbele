# Erbele

Erbele is a feature-rich text editor for macOS. Forked in 2016 from the Fraise github repository which was discontinued years ago, my main interest is to keep the popular app alive.

Supported macOS versions:

* macOS Sierra (10.12) - removed since 4.1.0 (previous versions with support for macOS Sierra are available in App Store)
* macOS High Sierra (10.13)
* macOS Mojave (10.14)
* macOS Catalina (10.15)
* macOS Big Sur (11)
* macOS Monterey (12)
* macOS Ventura (13)

Architectures: 

* Intel
* Apple Silicon (since version 3.11.0)

Author: Andreas Bentele

Based on the discontinued project [Fraise 3.7.3](https://github.com/jfmoy/Fraise).
Fraise originally was forked from [Smultron 3.5.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smultron/), maintained by Peter Borg.

# Downloads

[![Download on the Mac App Store](./Distribution/badge-download-on-the-mac-app-store.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/erbele/id1595456360?mt=12)

Starting with release 4.0 the app can be downloaded exclusively on the Mac App Store. Previous releases can be found here: [Releases](https://github.com/abentele/Erbele/releases).

*Why Erbele is no more free in App Store*

Starting with December 2022 Erbele is no more free in the Mac App Store.
It's now sold at a really small price, which is only needed to finance the Apple Developer ID for App Store Distribution.

I really appreciate every download. Every download contributes to distribution of Erbele in the Mac App Store in future. You pay only once and get future updates for free.
If you prefer free software or cannot afford the app from the Mac App Store, feel free to download the source code here from github and build Erbele with Xcode by yourself.

# Build release

If you are familiar with git and Xcode, you can checkout the git repository and build the app by yourself.

# Roadmap

Currently my main interest is to fix bugs, enhance already existing features and implement some new features while retaining the original focus and feature-set:

* powerful, but easy to use
* provide many helpful tools to edit texts
* support for many code languages (e.g. syntax highlighting)
