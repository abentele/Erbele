# Erbele

* macOS Catalina (10.15)

Based on the discontinued project [Fraise 3.7.3](https://github.com/jfmoy/Fraise).
Fraise originally was forked from [Smultron 3.5.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smultron/), maintained by Peter Borg.

# Build release

If you are familiar with git and Xcode, you can checkout the git repository and build the app by yourself.

# Roadmap

Currently my main interest is to fix bugs, enhance already existing features and implement some new features while retaining the original focus and feature-set:

* powerful, but easy to use
* provide many helpful tools to edit texts
* support for many code languages (e.g. syntax highlighting)
