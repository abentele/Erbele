.TH ERBELE 1 LOCAL

.SH NAME
erbele - A command-line utility for Erbele

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B erbele [file] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION

With erbele you can start the application Erbele by just writing erbele with no options. If you write something after erbele it considers that to be the path to the file or, if you write more than one path, the paths to the files. You can use the standard wildcards e.g. * and ~ for your home folder. If you don't specify a full path it adds the current working directory to what you write. If it can't find any of the specified files, it first creates them and then opens them. (Note that if you use a wildcard and it can't match a file to that it creates a file including the wildcard character as a character in the path, e.g. if you write erbele ~/Desktop/*.jsp and there aren't any .jsp-files on the desktop it creates a file called *.jsp on the desktop.)

.SH EXAMPLES

erbele - opens the application

erbele foo - opens foo from the current directory in Erbele

erbele ~/foo - opens foo from your home folder in Erbele

erbele ~/Desktop/fooDoesNotExist - creates the file fooDoesNotExist on your desktop and opens it in Erbele

erbele ~/Desktop/*.php /etc/*.conf - opens all the files that end with .php on the desktop and all files that ends with .conf in the /etc folder
